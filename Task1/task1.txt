Here I am creating NUMBER GAME in that user have to guess numbers .
it generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100 for gusseing the number.Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.it Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number for example user can gusse in 5 times only. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
number game is isplays the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
