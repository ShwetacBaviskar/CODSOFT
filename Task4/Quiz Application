This application is a simple quiz program built using Java Swing. It presents a series of questions with multiple-choice answers. Users can select one option per question and submit their answers. The program tracks the number of correct answers and displays the score at the end of the quiz. Additionally, there's a timer for each question, and if the time runs out, the program automatically moves to the next question.
